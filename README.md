# OpenCV Repository

This repository contains programs developed during the course DCA0445 - Digital Image Processing. The programs were implemented in Python, using the OpenCV library.

# Exercises
The exercises performed during the course cover a variety of topics related to digital image processing. The programs developed can be found in this folder and are briefly described below:

1. [2.2. Exercises](https://github.com/PedroHenrique18/OpenCV/tree/main/Manipulando%20pixels%20em%20uma%20imagem): Display the region defined by the rectangle with opposite vertices defined by points P1 and P2 with the negative of the image in the corresponding region.
2. [3.2 Exercises](https://github.com/PedroHenrique18/OpenCV/tree/main/Serializa%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20de%20dados%20em%20ponto%20flutuante%20via%20FileStorage): Generate an image of dimensions 256x256 pixels containing a sine wave of 4 periods with amplitude 127 drawn horizontally.
3. [4.3 Exercises](https://github.com/PedroHenrique18/OpenCV/tree/main/Decomposi%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20de%20imagens%20em%20planos%20de%20bits): Program to recover the encoded image from a steganography resulting image.
4. [5.2. Exercises](https://github.com/PedroHenrique18/OpenCV/tree/main/Preenchendo%20regi%C3%B5es): Identify regions with or without internal holes that exist in the scene.
5. [6.2. Exercises](https://github.com/PedroHenrique18/OpenCV/tree/main/Manipula%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20de%20histogramas): For each captured image, perform histogram equalization before displaying the image.
6. [7.2. Exercises](https://github.com/PedroHenrique18/OpenCV/tree/main/Filtragem%20no%20dom%C3%ADnio%20espacial%20I): The program should add one more functionality to the provided example, allowing the calculation of the Laplacian of Gaussian of the captured images.
7. [8.1. Exercises](https://github.com/PedroHenrique18/OpenCV/tree/main/Filtragem%20no%20dom%C3%ADnio%20espacial%20II): The photographic technique of tilt-shift involves the use of displacements and rotations between the lens and the projection plane (where the photographic film or camera sensor is located) in order to selectively blur regions of the subject.
8. [10.2. Exercises](https://github.com/PedroHenrique18/OpenCV/tree/main/Filtragem%20no%20Dom%C3%ADnio%20da%20Frequ%C3%AAncia): Implement the homomorphic filter to improve images with irregular illumination.
9. [11.3. Exercises](https://github.com/PedroHenrique18/OpenCV/tree/main/Detec%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20de%20bordas%20com%20o%20algoritmo%20de%20Canny): Describe in your report details of the procedure used to create your pointillist technique.
10. [12.2. Exercises](https://github.com/PedroHenrique18/OpenCV/tree/main/Quantiza%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20vetorial%20com%20k-means): Perform 10 different rounds of the algorithm and compare the produced images.
11. [13.2. Exercises](https://github.com/PedroHenrique18/OpenCV/tree/main/Filtragem%20de%20forma%20com%20morfologia%20matem%C3%A1tica): Create a program that solves the problem of pre-filtering form for character recognition using morphological operations.
